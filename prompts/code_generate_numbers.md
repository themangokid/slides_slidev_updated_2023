Scope, indentation, dynamically typed, performence and more differences between pyton and c++. 

Make slides using code in both languages.  Use code and do it in this way: 

""" python {1-3|5-14|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|15} {lines:true}
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] # List of fruits
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits): # Get index and fruit
    print(index, fruit)               # Print index and fruit
"""

Add a lot of text in these slides. Explain all of the concepts and show the difference in code. The slides can be long as long as it gets explained.
